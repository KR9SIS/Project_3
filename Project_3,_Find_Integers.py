#Write input 1: 1 integer, 20 <= stop_range <= 100
#Write input 2: 1 integer, 1 <= num_divisors <= 12

#Step 1
#Use range(10, stop_range) to cycle through numbers
#Find the sum of the numbers integers
    #Look at Assignment 3.5
#See if that sum squared is an integer
#Write a list of the numbers under stop_range which meet these criteria and if they do print them.

#Step 2
#Use range(10, stop_range) to cycle through numbers
#If the number mod(num_divisors) == 0 then that number works
#Print out all numbers which work
